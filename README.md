# Data Visualizations Repository

This repository contains various visualizations created using Matplotlib and NumPy. Many of the visualizations were generated by analyzing a database file of an imaginary theme park called "dinoworld.db."

The final project for this course involved applying techniques covered in the course to perform an analysis of college admissions and basic census information. The goal was to identify correlations between various features of students and the likelihood of having an income greater than $50,000.

## Features

- Utilizes Matplotlib and NumPy for data visualizations.
- Analysis based on the "dinoworld.db" database file.
- Final project involves the analysis of college admissions and census information.

## Installation

To explore the visualizations and analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FalseShepherd/data-visualizations.git
